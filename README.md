# Plant-Disease-Detection
A project for detecting plant diseases using AI for sustainable agriculture.

## Plant Disease Detection for Sustainable Agriculture

 ### 🔍 A deep learning-based project to detect plant diseases and promote sustainable agriculture.

## 🌱 Project Overview
Plant diseases significantly impact global food production, leading to economic losses for farmers. This project leverages AI and deep learning to identify plant diseases from images, helping farmers take early action and ensure sustainable agriculture.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3.10
TensorFlow & Keras (for deep learning)
OpenCV (for image processing)
Streamlit (for web-based visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (for model training)
Command Prompt & IDLE (for execution)

## 📊 Dataset Details

The dataset consists of images of healthy and diseased plants.
Classes include powdery mildew, rust, bacterial spot, and healthy leaves.
Images are preprocessed using OpenCV before being fed into the deep learning model.

## 🔬 Model Architecture

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for image classification.
Pretrained models like VGG16 or MobileNet can improve accuracy.
Adam Optimizer and Categorical Crossentropy loss function used.
